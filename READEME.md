# WhatsApp Cloud API Integration Learning Project

## Overview

This repository contains my learning journey and resources for integrating the WhatsApp Cloud API into web applications. Through this project, I'm exploring how to leverage WhatsApp's powerful messaging capabilities for business communications and chatbot development.

## Course Content

1. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
   - Creating a Meta Developer Account
   - Setting up a WhatsApp API Application
   - Configuring test phone numbers

2. **Exploring WhatsApp Cloud API Features**
   - Sending various types of messages:
     - Text messages (simple, formatted, with URL previews)
     - Media messages (images, videos, audio, documents)
     - Interactive messages (locations, buttons, list menus)
   - Understanding and using message templates

3. **Web Application Development**
   - Creating a Node.js server to interact with WhatsApp API
   - Implementing endpoints for sending and receiving messages
   - Handling webhook events

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploying the web application for public access
   - Integrating the deployed app with WhatsApp Cloud API

5. **Advanced Integration and Chatbot Development**
   - Creating a webhook for real-time message processing
   - Implementing a basic chatbot that interprets user messages and responds accordingly

## Tools and Technologies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- WhatsApp Cloud API
- Postman (for API testing)
- Visual Studio Code (or preferred code editor)
- Microsoft Azure (for deployment, alternatives like Render may be used)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Node.js if not already installed
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Set up a Meta Developer account and WhatsApp API application
5. Configure environment variables (access tokens, phone numbers, etc.)
6. Run the application using `node server.js` or `npm start`
